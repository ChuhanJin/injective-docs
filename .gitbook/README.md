# About Injective

### What is Injective?[​](https://docs.injective.network/learn/introduction#what-is-injective) <a href="#what-is-injective" id="what-is-injective"></a>

Injective is the blockchain built for finance.

It is the only blockchain where developers can use pre-built, customizable modules to create dynamic applications that aren't possible on other networks. Combined with optimizations to its core architecture and enhanced cross-chain interoperability, Injective offers a high-performance network, ready to efficiently and securely bring the global financial system on-chain.

Injective achieves instantly transaction finality through a custom implementation of the Tendermint Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus framework. Additionally, the network facilitates rapid cross-chain transactions, seamlessly connecting it to prominent layer-one networks like Ethereum, Solana, Cosmos Hub, and more.

The Injective ecosystem is a network of decentralized applications designed to offer a best-in-class user experience. By providing unrestricted and unprecedented access to decentralized financial markets, products, services, and tooling, the Injective ecosystem empowers individuals to allocate capital more efficiently.

### What are Modules?[​](https://docs.injective.network/learn/introduction#what-is-injective) <a href="#what-is-injective" id="what-is-injective"></a>

Modules are foundational components in Injective’s blockchain architecture, each built to provide specific functionalities. A _module_ is essentially a self-contained unit with well-defined logic and services, allowing Injective to efficiently manage diverse operations across the network.&#x20;

Modules work like building blocks that can be combined to expand the blockchain’s capabilities. This approach reduces the friction and technical complexity of implementing core features, making development easier. Each module operates independently but communicates with others through inter-module messaging, making Injective’s architecture modular and adaptable. This allows Injective to continuously evolve, delivering targeted upgrades and functionality without overhauling the entire system.

### Why Build on Injective?[​](https://docs.injective.network/learn/introduction#why-build-on-injective) <a href="#why-build-on-injective" id="why-build-on-injective"></a>

* **Optimized for DeFi**: Injective is equipped with specialized modules and low-latency infrastructure tailored for DeFi, enabling developers to build complex, high-performance applications with streamlined setup and deployment. This not only makes development easier, but also unlocks potential for creating new, innovative applications and technologies.&#x20;
* **Superior Performance:** Injective delivers the speed and efficiency required for commercial scalability, achieving 25,000+ TPS, with sub-second block times (650 ms) and instant transaction finality—all while averaging just $0.0003 per transaction.&#x20;
* **Highly Interoperable:** Injective is natively interoperable across 23+ sovereign blockchain networks, while also being IBC-enabled. It supports cross-chain transactions across Ethereum, IBC-enabled chains like Cosmos Hub, and Wormhole-integrated chains, such as Solana and Avalanche.
* **Integrated VM Environment**: Injective’s architecture natively integrates EVM and WASM into a unified and cohesive execution layer. This setup simplifies development workflows and significantly expands developers' ability to create dynamic and versatile applications.
* **Comprehensive Token Capability:** Since Injective supports cross-chain transactions with Ethereum and all IBC-enabled chains, tokens launched on Injective can be exposed to multiple networks by default.
* I**ntuitive Developer Experience:** Utilize flexible and expressive development environments powered by Rust, Golang, and Solidity.
